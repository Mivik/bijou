# Bijou

Bijou (['bi:ʒu], French for "jewel") is a tiny yet fast encrypted filesystem, built upon [RocksDB](https://github.com/facebook/rocksdb).

Bijou provides a FUSE interface, as well as Rust API (`bijou-core`) to manipulate the filesystem.

## Why Bijou?

The initial motivation of Bijou is to provide access to encrypted filesystem everywhere, without extra requirement for the host system. Most of currently available encrypted filesystems just rely on the underlying filesystem to do the most of the work (directory structure, filenames, metadata, xattrs, etc.), which both limits the portability and compromises the security.

Bijou is developed with safety and performance in mind. Almost all metadata is stored in a RocksDB database, which is patched to support at-rest encryption. Because of that, Bijou poses no extra requirement on the underlying filesystem. An abstraction of the storage layer makes it possible to store file contents nearly everywhere, including local file system, OpenDAL (experimental) or even RocksDB itself.

## **Warning**

Bijou is under active development and is not ready for production use. It's unstable (may crash!) and on-disk format may change. **You definitely don't want to use it to store your important data for now.**

## Features

- [x] File encryption with integrity check
- [x] Cross platform filesystem features: (hard or soft) links, xattrs, file permissions
- [x] Directory structure encryption
- [x] Customizable storage layer
- [x] Rust API
- [x] Filenames with arbitrary length

Currently Bijou is only tested on Linux, but it should work on other platforms as well.

## Performance

The following benchmark is done on a 14-core Intel i7-12700H CPU with 32GB RAM and a 1T NVMe SSD.

[^1]: securefs does not support O_DIRECT flag

Bijou might be slower in cases where directory structure or file metadata is frequently accessed since they are stored in a separate database. However, Bijou still outperforms other filesystems in most cases.

## Installation

```bash
cargo install --git https://github.com/Mivik/bijou
```

## Usage

```bash
# Create a database
bijou create <data-dir>

# Mount it
bijou mount <data-dir> <mountpoint>
```

See `bijou --help` for more information.
